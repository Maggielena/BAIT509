Construct the decision rule according to this classification boundary. How would you classify a new observation that has X1=6 and X2=10?
The decision rule is based on the middle line. If X1 < 7.5, it is classified as A
if X1 > 7.5, it is classified as B

Thus, X1 = 6 and X2= 10 will be classifed as A

What size is the margin here?
Size of the margin is 2
                  
Which observations receive a penalty? Which observations are the support vectors?
Observations 8, 9, 6, 10 and 7 will be receive penalty. They are also support vectors

What is the total penalty here?
6: +0.25
7: +0.25
8: +1.25
9: +1.75
10:+2.25
Thus, the total is 5.75

Can I choose a bigger margin if my total allowable penalty is 6?
Yes. However, if we pick a margin that is close to 0, the penalty would be infinity. We need further calculation to find the optimal. 


Are the data separable? If so, what are the support vectors?
Yes.The support vectors are 4,8,9 and then expand the margin as much as you can until hit some observations.
