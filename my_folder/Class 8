For (1) and (2) below, you're choosing between two candidates to hire. Discuss the pros and cons of choosing one candidate over the other in the following situations.

1.	The variance of A is lower compared to B as the range of his or her productivity is smaller. Meaning that sometime B might outperform A,
but sometimes might not. However, the probability of A being productive at a score of 75 is much higher compared to B based on density. 
Thus, A should be hired as his or her performance is more stable. 
2.	The productivity score of B is 80 while the productivity score of A is 60 and the variance of B is higher compared to that of A. 
Although A's preformance is more stable, the best performance A can get is around 62. Even though sometimes B is not doing his best, i.e. getting
70ish in productivity, he or she still outperforms A. Thus, B should be hired. In reality, it really depends on the job descriptions.
3.	Our forecast has a response score of 0, however the test set indicates that the actual values tend to be around 2. 
Thus, our model is very likely to be biased. We might want to reduce the tunning parameters.
